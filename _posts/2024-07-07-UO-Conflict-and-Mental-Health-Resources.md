## Mental health/well-being resources at University of Oregon 

_Professional service_

Graduate students have access to numerous types of therapy and special sessions through the UO counseling center. 
Students can access these resources by going to the University health services in person or via phone call.  

* Here they can perform a same-day evaluation, and afterwards students will be referred to counseling services or psychiatry.  
 
 * Types of counseling services include one-on-one therapy or group therapy with 6 to 10 individuals.
   Here they can address emotional concerns, relationship issues, or personal struggles with a therapist located on campus.  
 
* There are also therapists who specialize in working with students from specific demographics 
 
* The counseling center also has ‘special sessions’, which come at no extra cost and create a space for students
  from a specific demographic. For example, there are many black student sessions, including Wellness Wednesdays at the
  Black Cultural Center, and other services for LGBTQ+ and Latinx students. 
 
* The cost of this therapy covered by the Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation insurance policy.  


UO also offers many resources for students when they are in need of a casual support system.  

* Groups such as ‘Sista circle’ for black female-identifying graduate students and sessions such as ‘Lets Talk’
  hosted by counseling service staff who specialize in working with graduate students aim to create community for
  all graduate students. 
 
* Strategy groups are coalitions of faculty, staff, and students who are dedicated to supporting either Native, Black,
  Latino, Asian, Desi Pacific Islander, or white members of the community by fostering comradery and empathy across
  the university and the Eugene community.  
 
* Lastly, the university has many affinity groups that create space for self-identifying students and allies to discuss
  community and university issues they face.  


When a majority of the previously listed resources shut down due to the pandemic, UO created free
subscriptions for apps geared towards social connection and mental health.  
* The app WellTrack students can manage depression and anxiety. Students can share their app progress with UO therapists now that in-person counseling has returned.  
 
* Nod is a research-backed app that helps students connect using the science of social connection. Students can access these apps for free using their student ID number. 
 

_Student/Faculty led efforts_

There are also many well-being resources for graduate students in the STEM departments, such as

* the Center for Minorities in STEM (CMIS) which works towards fostering a supportive and inclusive
  community for ethnic and cultural minorities in STEM. 
 
* STEM graduate students have also created student organizations to cater to specific groups, such as Gender Inclusion
  in Neuroscience and Graduate Evolutionary Biology and Ecology Students. These groups create spaces for graduate
  students to address issues within specific subfields and build a forward-thinking community. 
 
* the Positive Psychology club and the Oregon Mindfulness club both focus on science-based tools, such as meditation
  and yoga, to improve student’s mindset.  
 
* the UO Outdoor Program focuses on making the outdoors a more accessible space for students by lowering financial
  and cultural barriers. 
 
* the Center for the Science and Practice of Well-Being is bringing together faculty members from diverse fields and
  creating mental health resources to improve the community. This center has a faculty advisory board with expertise in
  psychology, art, and neuroscience. While this center just had its inaugural meeting in October 2023, it already hosts
  mindfulness-based stress reduction workshops and retreats  



##Mechanisms to help resolve conflict between you and your adviser 

If conflict arises students should talk to their advisor and ask to revisit the goals that are set in their individual 
training plan (this requires that there is a training plan in place, which is highly recommended when you first join a lab). 
This plan should contain mutually agreed upon goals that serve as a guideline for upcoming years, and in the event of a 
conflict it could serve as a helpful resource that could frame a conflict in the context of logical and intentional goals.  
 
If students want another opinion or guidance from another faculty member on the conflict matter, they should reach out to 
their Dissertation Advisory Committee (DAC).  
 
The university also has many resources for graduate students in the event of a conflict escalation with their advisor. 
One resource designed specifically for graduate school conflict is UO DuckREFS, or Resource for Easing Friction and Stress,
which is a group of staff and graduate students trained in identifying and handling conflict associated with graduate school.
Their mission is to improve the graduate student experience by offering confidential resources for graduate students. 
They have many graduate students and staff who work outside of the biology field but still have personal experience 
with research advisors. If students feel inclined to seek advice and resources from someone who does not know their advisor, 
they can email or call DuckREFS to schedule an appointment to discuss the conflict.  
 
Another easily accessible resource is the Student Conflict Resolution Center, which has appointments for individuals or 
groups conveniently located on campus or via zoom. They offer mediated conflict coaching and group 
facilitations and provide a private and impartial service for all UO students.
